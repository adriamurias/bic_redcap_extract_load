# REDCap Export & Load
Python code to extract and load data from a REDCap project via its API (see [Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia guide](https://education.arcus.chop.edu/redcap-api/)), and transfer the resulting dataframes to a MariaDB SQL database. This code was developed for the *Structured Data Treatment* module of the [Clinical Bioinformatics course at Eixample Clinic](https://eixampleclinic.es/ca/cursos-formacion-reglada/bioinformatica-clinica/).
